Error-based SQL injection, the attacker forces the database to return error messages in response to his/her inputs. 

Later, the attacker may analyze the error messages obtained from the underlying database to gather information that can be used for constructing the malicious query. 

The attacker uses this type of SQL injection technique when he/she is unable to exploit any other SQL injection techniques directly. 

The primary goal of this technique is to generate the error message from the database, which can be used to perform a successful SQL injection attack. 

Such exploitation may differ from one DBMS to another

Consider the following SQL query:
SELECT * FROM products WHERE id_product=$id_product 

The malicious request would be (e.g., Oracle 10g): 
http://www.example.com/product.php? id=10||UTL_INADDR.GET_HOST_NAME( (SELECT user FROM DUAL) )â€”

Then, the tester can manipulate the parameter passed to the GET_HOST_NAME() function and the result will be shown in the error message.
