Bypassing website logins is a fundamental and common malicious activity that an attacker can perform using SQL injection. 

This is the easiest way to exploit any SQL injection vulnerability of the application. 

An attacker can bypass the login mechanism (authentication mechanism) of the application by injecting malicious code (in the form of an SQL command) into any user’s account without entering a username and password.

The attacker inserts the malicious SQL string in a website login form to bypass the login mechanism of the application. 

Attackers can fully exploit SQL vulnerabilities. Programmers chain SQL commands and user-provided parameters together. 

By using this feature, the attacker executes arbitrary SQL queries and commands on the backend database server through the web application

You can “union” the results with a known password and the MD5 hash of a supplied password. 

The web application will compare your password and the supplied MD5 hash instead of the MD5 from the database

For example: Username : admin
Password : 1234 ' AND 1=0 UNION ALL SELECT 'admin', '81dc9bdb52d04dc20036dbd8313ed055 81dc9bdb52d04dc20036dbd8313ed055 = MD5(1234)
