▪ Inserting a New User using SQL Injection If an attacker can learn about the structure of the users table in a database, he/she can attempt to insert new user details into that table. 

Once the attacker is successful in adding new user details, he/she can directly use the new user credentials to logon to the web application. 

For example,
an attacker can exploit the following query:
SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Email_ID = ‘Alice@xyz.com’ After injecting the INSERT statement into the above query,

SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Email_ID = ‘Alice@xyz.com’; INSERT INTO Users (Email_ID, User_Name, Password) VALUES (‘Clark@mymail.com’,’Clark’,’MyPassword’);--‘;


▪ Updating Password using SQL Injection
Many web applications use a login that requires a username and password to give users access to the services provided by the organization. Sometimes, users forget their passwords. 

To address this issue, developers provide a Forgot Password feature, which delivers a forgotten password or a new password to the user’s registered email address (the address the user provided when originally registering with the site).

If this succeeds, the forgotten or new password will be sent to the attacker’s email address. 

The attacker uses the UPDATE SQL command to overwrite the user’s email address in the application database.

For example, 
if an attacker is able to learn that a user with an email address “Alice@xyz.com” exists, he/she can UPDATE the email address to the attacker’s address.

An attacker injects the UPDATE statement into the following query: SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Email_ID = ‘Alice@xyz.com’

After injecting UPDATE statement into the above query,
SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Email_ID = ‘Alice@xyz.com’; UPDATE Users SET Email_ID = ‘Clark@mymail.com’ WHERE Email_ID =’Alice@xyz.com’;

The result of executing the above query is that the users table is updated by changing the email address “Alice@xyz.com” to “Clark@mymail.com.” 

Now, the attacker opens the web application’s login page in a browser and clicks on the “Forgot Password?” link. 

Then, the web application sends an email to the attacker’s email address for resetting the password of Alice.
