Out-of-band SQL injection attacks are difficult to perform because the attacker needs to communicate with the server and determine the features of the database server used by the web application. 

In this attack, the attacker uses different communication channels (such as database email functionality or file writing and loading functions) to perform the attack and obtain the results. 

Attackers use this technique instead of in-band or blind SQL injection if they are unable to use the same channel through which the requests are being made to launch the attack and gather the results.

Attackers use DNS and HTTP requests to retrieve data from the database server. 

For example, in Microsoft SQL Server, an attacker exploits the xp_dirtree command to send DNS requests to a server controlled by the attacker. 

Similarly, in Oracle Database, an attacker may use the UTL_HTTP package to send HTTP requests from SQL or PL/SQL to a server controlled by the attacker.
