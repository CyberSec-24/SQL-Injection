Function Testing

Function testing is a type of software testing technique whereby a software or a system is tested against a set of inputs according to the end user’s needs. 

The output obtained from the inputs is then evaluated and compared with the expected results to check whether it conforms with the functionality or base requirements of a product

It checks the security, user interface, database, client/server applications, navigational functions, and overall usability of a component or system

For example:
http://certifiedhacker.com/?parameter=123            http://certifiedhacker.com/?parameter=1"
http://certifiedhacker.com/?parameter=1'              http://certifiedhacker.com/?parameter=1'#  


 Fuzz Testing
It is an adaptive SQL injection testing technique used to discover coding errors by inputting a massive amount of random data and observing the changes in the output.

Fuzz testing (fuzzing) is a black box testing method. It is a quality checking and assurance technique used to identify coding errors and security loopholes in web applications. 

Massive amounts of random data called “fuzz” will be generated by the fuzz testing tools (fuzzers) and used against the target web application to discover vulnerabilities that can be exploited by various attacks.
