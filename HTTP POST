An HTTP POST request is a method for carrying the requested data to the web server. 

Unlike the HTTP GET method, the HTTP POST request carries the requested data as a part of the message body. 

Thus, it is considered more secure than HTTP GET. HTTP POST requests can also pass large amounts of data to the server. 

They are ideal for communicating with an XML web service. These methods submit and retrieve data from the web server. 

When a user provides information and clicks Submit, the browser submits a string to the web server that contains the userâ€™s credentials. 

This string is visible in the body of the HTTP or HTTPS POST request as select * from Users where (username = 'smith' and password = 'simpson');
