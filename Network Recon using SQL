Network reconnaissance is the process of testing any potential vulnerability in a computer network. 

However, network reconnaissance is also a major type of network attack. 

Network reconnaissance can be reduced to some extent but not eliminated. 

Attackers use network mapping tools such as Nmap and Network Topology Mapper to determine the vulnerabilities of the network.

▪ The steps for assessing network connectivity are as follows: 
o Retrieve server name and configuration using ' and 1 in (select @@servername ) --
' and 1 in (select srvname from sys.sysservers ) --

o Use utilities such as NetBIOS, ARP, Local Open Ports, nslookup, ping, ftp, tftp, smb, and traceroute to assess networks

o Test for firewalls and proxies

▪To perform network reconnaissance, you can execute the following using the xp_cmdshell command:

o Ipconfig/all, tracert myIP, arp –a, nbtstat –c, netstat –ano, route print


# Finding and Bypassing Admin Panel of a Website #

Attackers try to find the admin panel of a website using simple Google dorks and bypass administrator authentication using an SQL injection attack.

An attacker generally uses Google dorks to find the URL of an admin panel. 

For example, the attacker may try the following dorks to find the admin panel of a website: 
▪ inurl:”adminlogin.aspx” 
▪ inurl:”admin/index.php”

Using the above dorks, an attacker may form the following URLs to access the admin login page of a website: 
▪ http://www.certifiedhacker.com/admin.php 
▪ http://www.certifiedhacker.com/admin/
